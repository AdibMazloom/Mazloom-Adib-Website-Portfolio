## ðŸ“ˆ Investment Portfolio Analysis

In my Investment and Financial Markets course, I managed a simulated investment portfolio designed to apply asset allocation theories, portfolio diversification, and risk management strategies.

Key activities included:
- Allocating investments across healthcare, technology, energy, and materials sectors
- Tracking portfolio performance over time compared to market benchmarks
- Analyzing volatility, returns, and sector-specific trends

Below is a performance chart from the first month of the portfolio simulation:
